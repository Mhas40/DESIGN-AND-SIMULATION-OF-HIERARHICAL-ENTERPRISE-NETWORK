# üì° Design and Simulation of Hierarchical Enterprise Network

A comprehensive enterprise network designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer, implementing a scalable hierarchical architecture with OSPF routing and efficient IP addressing to ensure robust connectivity and optimized data flow.

---

## üìò Project Overview

This project presents the complete design, configuration, and validation of a hierarchical enterprise network topology. It uses **Class A IP addressing** and **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** as the dynamic routing protocol to establish seamless communication between multiple segments. All configurations are performed in **Cisco Packet Tracer** with a focus on modularity, performance, and scalability.
